# Functional Programming Sydney

* We are a seminar and social group for people in Sydney, Australia interested in Functional Programming.
* We're interested in Clean, Erlang, F#, Haskell, LISP, Mercury, Ocaml, Scala, Scheme, and more.
* We also have a contingent interested in theorem provers such as Coq and Isabelle.

## Evening Meetings
* Meetings are usually held on the fourth Wednesday of each month at ​Atlassian.
* Anyone who is interested is welcome to come along.
* Meetings are announced on:
  * The ​mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fp-syd
  * The Slack channel. Get one of the existing members to add you to Slack.

## Daytime Workshops
* A full day event is held on a Saturday once every two months.
* Anyone who is interested is welcome to come along.
* We spend about half the time on presentations, and half on hacking and free-form discussion.
  * Doors open 10am, talks begin 10:30am. We'll go to the pub about 5pm.
* All attendees give at least a 10 minute talk, though we can also schedule longer presentations.
  * Everyone talks. No exceptions.
  * The talk could be about something you're working on, something you've already done, something you learned about, a idea you had, anything.
  * If you don't know what to talk about then read a recent paper from ICFP, Haskell Symposium, Scheme workshop, IFL or a similar event and give a summary. You could also learn about a new library and give a short review. It doesn't need to be mainline functional programming. We also like other areas of computer science.
  * If this is your first time attending then it's fine to just give a short overview of who you are, what you're working on, and what you're interested in. You don't need slides, but it usually helps to show examples of what you've done.
  * RSVP to the thread in the Slack channel with your talk title and expected length. We'll sort out the schedule a few days before, depending on the number of attendees and talk lengths.
